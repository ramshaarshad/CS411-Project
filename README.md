# CS411-Project
Our project is a collaborative music queuing system that allows its users to input their recommended song into the queue where other users that are using the application can rate the song by giving it a thumbs up or down. Based on the ratings the song gets, it will either move up or down in the queue. This will be implemented with the use of the Spotify API. This platform will have the power to alter the way groups interact with music in social settings. Today, you can use apps and subscriptions to listen to music individually, but at parties or events, collective listening is the objective. However this can often get muddled away when hosts prepare their playlists in advance as the organic, dynamic, and spontaneous contribution to a partyâ€™s mood goes missing. Additionally, the host conventionally holds a great deal of responsibility in terms of the music that gets played at social events and often times people are left unsatisfied because everyone has different music tastes/preferences. With the use of this application, this sentiment will no longer be an issue. Through this user centric platform, the power will be put back in the hands of the party goers as they will have the ability to choose what music they want played.
